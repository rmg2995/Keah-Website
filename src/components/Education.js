        I am currently working through a curriculum designed to provide the
        knowledge and skills needed to be a successful pharmacist. While
        completing the core curriculum, I also had elective courses and
        certification trainings to expand my experiences and skills, such as the
        NACDS Point-of-Care testing and pharmacy-based immunization
        certification.{" "}

        Combining my passion for helping others and my love for chemistry and
        the sciences, I worked towards my B.A. in Chemistry degree with a
        pre-pharmacy tract. While completing my core degree classes, I used my
        elective credits to take all the necessary science classes needed for
        pharmacy school, including microbiology, biochemistry, and genetics. I
        was also involved in a pre-pharmacy student association where I attended
        meetings to gain more knowledge about the field and had opportunities to
        learn from pharmacistsâ€™ experiences.
