      <h3>Community Fest 2020 Health Fair</h3>
      <p>
        During my P2 year, I volunteered to help run the SSHP booth for the
        Community Fest Health Fair. Our aim was to highlight the importance of a
        healthy, balanced diet. Our poster board presentation was a game
        tailored for young children. I especially enjoyed this experience
        because of my interest in being a pediatric pharmacist and I was able to
        interact with children and practice counseling.
